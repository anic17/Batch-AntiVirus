# Batch Antivirus

In this repository you will find the best Batch-created Antivirus: Batch Antivirus! (BAV)
We store the database and some antivirus files.

### Is Batch Antivirus good enough to use as a regular antivirus?

Sadly, answer is no. Batch Antivirus contains a too small database, so new malware isn't there. 
We recomend using another antivirus like Microsoft Defender or Malwarebytes.  
But, you can use real-time protection along Microsoft Defender, that will be safer.

### Does Batch Antivirus needs to be installed?

No, you can use it portably with a non-administrator account. It doesn't create any services nor process.  

### Why is scanning so slow?

Scanning is slow because it launches a different process for every file. We're trying to optimize it.

### Does web protection register websites I visit?

No, Batch Antivirus doesn't collect **any** data.  
Privacy is always important for us.


### What I need to do if I want to use the database?

You can distribute and sell programs along with database, but please credit us as it's not easy to make a such big database searching all the hashes manually
